          <blockquote>
            <p>Howard also developed a set of Brooklyn-accented reactions and expressions that the other Stooges would imitate long after he had left the act:</p>
            <footer><cite><strong>"Nyuk, nyuk, nyuk"</strong> – Curly Howard's trademark laugh, accompanied by manic finger-snapping, often used to amuse himself <br>
<strong>"Woob, woob, woob!"</strong> –cheering used when he was either happy, scared, dazed, or flirting with a "dame"<br>
<strong>"Hmmm!"</strong> – an under-the-breath, high-pitched sound meant to show frustration<br>
<strong>"Nyahh-ahhh-ahhh!"</strong> – scared reaction (this was the reaction most often used by the other Stooges after Howard's departure)<br>
<strong>"La-Dee"</strong> or simply "La, la, laaa" – his singing used when he was acting innocently right before taking out an enemy<br>
<strong>"Ruff Ruff"</strong> – dog bark, used to give an enemy a final push before departing the scene, expressing anger, showing defiance or barking at an attractive dame<br>
<strong>"Ha-cha-cha!"</strong> – a take on Jimmy Durante's catchphrase<br>
<strong>"I'm a victim of soicumstance!</strong> [circumstance]"-used to express uncertainty
<strong>"Soitenly!"</strong> ("certainly")<br>
<strong>"I'll moider you!"</strong> ("I'll murder you!")<br>
<strong>"Huff huff huff!"</strong> – sharp, huffing exhales either due to excitement or meant to provoke a foe<br>
<strong>"Ah-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba!"</strong> – used during his later years, a sort of nonsense, high-pitched yelling that signified being scared or overly excited<br>
<strong>"Indubitably"</strong> – an expression used to feign an intelligent response <br>
His teeth, while chattering nervously, made the sound of a small hammer striking a chisel
<strong>"Oh! A WISE guy, eh?"</strong> – annoyed response <br>
<strong>"Oh, look!"</strong> – surprised remark, usually about a common object <br>
